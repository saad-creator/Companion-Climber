## Welcome to Companion Climber App

Champion Climber lets you see your progress virtually climbing two historic landmarks - The Juyongguan Pass at the Great Wall of China, and The Empire State Building on your Apple Watch. You appear as a red climber icon and as you climb flights of stairs, the app updates your icon's position.

The Home Screen shows the Daily results: Floors Climbed, % Vertical Mile, and Vertical Feet. Swipe left to see the Great Wall, swipe again to see the Empire State building and with one final swipe you see a summary of Daily, Monthly (last 30 days) and Overall stats of Floors, % Vertical Mile and Vertical Feet.

You can reset Daily, Monthly and Overall independently. A surprise awaits you when you reach the top of either the Juyongguan Pass or Empire State Building.
